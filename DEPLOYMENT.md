# Hebrews Commentary deployment

The production site is configured for:

`https://hebrews.mybibleexplorer.com`

The Next.js application uses a static export. A push to `main` runs the full
content validation, TypeScript, lint, and production build checks; uploads the
`out/` directory; and deploys it through GitHub Pages.

## One-time GitHub setup

1. Create the repository at `https://github.com/samirtharaj7-creator/Hebrews`
   and push this project to its `main` branch.
2. Open **Settings → Pages** in the repository and select **GitHub Actions** as
   the publishing source.
3. In the Pages custom-domain field, enter
   `hebrews.mybibleexplorer.com`.
4. At the DNS provider for `mybibleexplorer.com`, add this record:

   | Type | Host | Target |
   | --- | --- | --- |
   | CNAME | `hebrews` | `samirtharaj7-creator.github.io` |

5. After GitHub provisions the certificate, enable **Enforce HTTPS**.

Verifying `mybibleexplorer.com` in the GitHub account settings is also
recommended to protect its Pages subdomains from takeover.

## Local production check

```bash
npm ci
npm run validate
npm run typecheck
npm run lint
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://hebrews.mybibleexplorer.com npm run build
```

The generated `out/` directory must contain `index.html`, `404.html`,
`.nojekyll`, `CNAME`, and all thirteen chapter pages under
`out/hebrews/`.
